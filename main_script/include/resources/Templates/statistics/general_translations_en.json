Seek allies to help you reach your goals; but even the strongest players require assistance.The predominant task is always to survive and grow. In order to start on sound footing, simply solve the tasks I give you. Protect your resources and villages from greedy neighbors. In case you are struggling, you can find some additional help here: [ANSWERS_FARM]At the start, you can often avoid enemy attacks, however you should defend yourself against conquer attempts. Without troops, you won't be able to help yourself nor your allies. More information here: [ANSWERS_TROOPS]Once the dust of the first battles has settled, the strongest alliances will start fighting for control of ever larger territories.

You can\u2019t steal them and cart them off over the hills nor can you conquer just the city to gain the effects of the artifact.
